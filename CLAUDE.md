## üèóÔ∏è **TIER SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (Updated 2025-01)**

### **Realistic Premium Limits Philosophy**
The Gold tier moved from "unlimited" (999) to **realistic premium limits** for business sustainability:

**Why This Change?**
- ‚úÖ **Cost Protection**: Prevents API abuse from heavy users
- ‚úÖ **Still Premium**: Gold limits are 10-30x higher than Silver
- ‚úÖ **Better UX**: Users see achievable numbers vs confusing "‚àû"
- ‚úÖ **Business Model**: Sustainable for long-term growth

### **Current Tier Comparison Table**
```
Feature         | Bronze | Silver | Gold  | Ratio (Gold/Bronze)
----------------|--------|--------|-------|-------------------
Decoder         | 5      | 15     | 100   | 20x higher
Fortune         | 5      | 12     | 150   | 30x higher  
Horoscope       | 5      | 10     | 50    | 10x higher
Creative Writer | 5      | 15     | 75    | 15x higher
AI Images       | 0      | 12     | 50    | Premium exclusive
```

### **Companion-Tier-Based Architecture**
**CRITICAL**: The system uses **companion-tier-based limits**, not user-tier-based:

- **Bronze user + Gold companion** = Shows Gold features (100/150/50/75 limits)
- **Gold user + Bronze companion** = Shows Bronze features (5/5/5/5 limits)  
- **Usage tracking** = Per-companion (each companion tracks separately)

**Implementation:**
- Templates: `{% if companion_tier == 'gold' %}` (not user_plan)
- APIs: Return companion-tier limits (not user subscription limits)
- Session keys: `decoder_usage_{user_id}_{companion_id}_{date}` format

### Key Trial Design Principles:
1. **Trial is for BRONZE users only** - Silver/Gold don't need to trial their own tiers
2. **Trial unlocks ACCESS, not BENEFITS** - can taste tiers but limits stay the same
3. **No false hope** - Silver/Gold keep their actual limits during trial
4. **Credit system** - 60 trial credits let users taste credit features
5. **Time limited** - 5 hours to explore, then back to Bronze tier
6. **One-time only** - prevents abuse

### Credit Purchase System:
**Who Can Buy**: Silver and Gold tier subscribers only (monthly OR yearly)
**Purpose**: Get additional artistic time when monthly/yearly allocation runs out
**Pricing**: TBD (likely $5-10 for 50-100 additional credits)
**Behavior**: 
- Purchased credits add to current balance
- Used before monthly credits reset
- Only available to active subscribers (prevents cancelled users from purchasing)
- Accessible through dedicated credits purchase page
- **NO ROLLOVER**: All unused credits (monthly + purchased) are lost at billing cycle reset

### Subscription & Cancellation Policy:
**Payment**: Pay first - charged immediately upon subscribing (monthly or yearly)
**Cancellation**: No refunds - you keep access for the full period you paid for
**Monthly Subs**: Cancel anytime, keep benefits until your month ends, then revert to Bronze tier
**Yearly Subs**: Cancel anytime, keep benefits until your year ends, then revert to Bronze tier  
**Credit Purchasing**: Blocked once subscription is cancelled (even during remaining paid period)
**Auto-Renewal**: Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled before billing period ends

### Implementation Notes:
- `get_effective_plan()` - Returns "gold" for Bronze trial users (companion access only)
- `get_feature_limit()` - Always uses actual user_plan (never trial effective_plan)  
- Trial users can access Silver/Gold companions but see their actual tier limits
- Credit depletion locks credit features but chat/basic features remain available
- Subscription benefits are permanent until cancelled
- Credit purchasing requires active Silver/Gold subscription verification

### Tier Mapping (Internal):
- **bronze** (was: free) - Basic tier with ads
- **silver** (was: growth) - Enhanced tier, no ads  
- **gold** (was: max) - Premium tier, unlimited features
- **platinum** (future) - Ultra premium tier
- **diamond** (future) - Ultimate tier

### Commands to remember:
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality
- `npm run typecheck` - Verify TypeScript
