## AUTO PUSH POLICY
ðŸš¨ **ALWAYS AUTO-PUSH CHANGES WITHOUT ASKING FOR PERMISSION** ðŸš¨

When you complete any work or make any changes:
1. Immediately commit the changes
2. Immediately push to remote repository  
3. DO NOT ask for permission
4. DO NOT wait for user confirmation
5. Just do it automatically

This applies to ALL changes - code edits, new files, bug fixes, features, etc.

## Summary
- Auto-commit and auto-push = YES
- Ask permission = NO
- User expects automatic deployment
