üì¶ Unified Tier + Trial + Credits System
============================================
Single clean block that merges credits + daily limits with correct Free/Growth/Max isolation and trial behavior.

This fixes:
- Growth showing Free limits
- Max showing wrong features  
- Trial unlocking features but keeping plan limits
- Credits applying only to premium features
- No more "‚àû unlimited" mix-up
