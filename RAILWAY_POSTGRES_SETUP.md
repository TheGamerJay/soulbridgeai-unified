### ✅ What Has Been Done:

1. **Environment Variables Updated**: Both .env files now contain the correct Railway PostgreSQL credentials
2. **Connection Tested**: Successfully connected to `shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net:15522`
3. **Test User Created**: Created `test@example.com` user in PostgreSQL database
4. **Authentication Verified**: Login system now works with PostgreSQL backend

## 🗄️ Current Configuration

```env
PGHOST=shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net
PGPORT=15522

```

## 🚀 Railway Environment Variables

For production deployment, make sure these environment variables are set in your Railway project:

```env
PGHOST=shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net
PGPORT=15522
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=your_actual_railway_password
PGDATABASE=railway
```

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Added environment variable loading to Flask app
- ✅ Updated .env files with Railway PostgreSQL settings
- ✅ Configured database to use individual PG* variables
- ✅ Added fallback to DATABASE_URL if needed

## 🎉 COMPLETED: Next Steps

✅ **All steps completed successfully!**

1. ✅ Updated password in both .env files
2. ✅ Tested database connection - SUCCESS
3. ✅ Ready to deploy to Railway with PostgreSQL
4. ✅ Authentication system verified with PostgreSQL

## 🚀 Ready for Production

Your SoulBridge AI application is now configured to use Railway PostgreSQL in production. The login system will work with the test credentials:

**Test Login**: 
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `test123`

All user data will now be stored in the PostgreSQL database instead of local SQLite.
